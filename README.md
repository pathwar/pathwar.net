# FAQ

## How to play ?

You need to go on http://portal.pathwar.net and register an account.

For school contests: you need to register with your school's email (epitech.eu, 42.fr, mit.edu)
You will then be able to create a team and invite your team mates.


## Why do I need to stay anonymous ?

It's a school-contest feature.
Every user can steal half of your Kekos by denouncing you, knowing your team name.


## Kekos ?!

It's a school-contest feature that gives the ability to buy new level


## Medals

The first three team that validate a level get a medal (gold, silver and bronze).
It gives them extra points


## Can I use a vulnerability scanner ?

We do not support that choice, because you won't learn what we're trying to teach you.
Plus, you need to explain how you got the passphrase and it won't be possible since it's a script that did the work for you :)


## Validation message ?

For the school contests, you need to give a validation message that we will use to accept/refuse your validations.
Plus, a cool explanation may gives you some bonus points.

We accept messages in english, french and we love to have attached code


## I don't have any kekos left

Send us an email and we'll see what we can do.


## I have a question which is not listed here

Tell us on [IRC](#irc-), send us an [email](mailto:team@pathwar.net) or open an [issue](https://github.com/pathwar/pathwar.net/issues).

We'll answer as soon as possible and put the question/answer here if we think it'll help more people.


## Getting tired ?

Try to hack the portal, the API, the sandbox
You will certainly get extra credits by doing so.
Plus you'll be able to create a new kind of level inspired by your exploits
